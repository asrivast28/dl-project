This webpage template is based on a similar template from Dr. Devi Parikh's

<!-- Goal -->
<h2>Abstract</h2>

One or two sentences on the motivation behind the problem you are solving. One or two sentences describing the approach you took. One or two sentences on the main result you obtained.
<br><br>

<h2>Teaser figure</h2>
A figure that conveys the main idea behind the project or the main application being addressed. (This one is from <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">AlexNet</a>.)

<!-- Introduction -->
<h2>Introduction / Background / Motivation</h2>
<h4>What did you try to do? What problem did you try to solve? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. (5 points)</h4>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

<h4>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice? (5 points)</h4>
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

<h4>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make? (5 points)</h4>
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

<br><br>
<!-- Approach -->
<h2>Approach</h2>
<h4>What did you do exactly? How did you solve the problem? Why did you think it would be successful? Is anything new in your approach? (10 points)</h4>
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

<h4>What problems did you anticipate? What problems did you encounter? Did the very first thing you tried work? (5 points)</h4>
Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.

<br><br>
<!-- Results -->
<h2>Experiments and Results</h2>
<h4>How did you measure success? What experiments were used? What were the results, both quantitative and qualitative? Did you succeed? Did you fail? Why? (10 points)</h4>
Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt.

<!-- Additional Points to Consider (REMOVE BEFORE SUBMISSION) -->
<h2> Additional Points to Consider (REMOVE BEFORE SUBMISSION)</h2>
<h4>Appropriate use of visual aids. Are the ideas presented with appropriate illustration? Is the problem effectively visualized? Is the approach visualized appropriately? Are the results presented clearly; are the important differences illustrated? Every section and idea does not need a visual aid, but the most interesting and complex parts of the project should be illustrated. (5 points)</h4>
Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt.

<h4>Overall clarity. Is the presentation clear? Can a peer who has also taken Deep Learning understand all of the points addressed above? Is sufficient detail provided? (5 points)</h4>
Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt.

<h4>Finally, points will be distributed based on your understanding of how your project relates to Deep Learning. Here are some questions to think about: (10 points)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What was the structure of your problem? How did the structure of your model reflect the structure of your problem?</li>
  <li>What parts of your model had learned parameters (e.g., convolution layers) and what parts did not (e.g., post-processing classifier probabilities into decisions)?</li>
  <li>What representations of input and output did the neural network expect? How was the data pre/post-processed?</li>
  <li>What was the loss function?</li>
  <li>Did the model overfit? How well did the approach generalize?</li>
  <li>What hyperparameters did the model have? How were they chosen? How did they affect performance? What optimizer was used?</li>
  <li>What Deep Learning framework did you use?</li>
  <li>What existing code or models did you start with and what did those starting points provide?</li>
</ul>
At least some of these questions and others should be relevant to your project and should be addressed in the webpage. You do not need to address all of them in full detail. Some may be irrelevant to your project and others may be standard and thus require only a brief mention. For example, it is sufficient to simply mention the cross-entropy loss was used and not provide a full description of what that is. Generally, provide enough detail that someone with an appropriate background (in both Deep Learning and your domain of choice) could replicate the main parts of your project somewhat accurately, probably missing a few less important details.
