# On Improving Unsupervised Learning with DeepCluster

This repository is meant for collaborating on the Deep Learning project on [Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05520), the code for which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deepcluster).

Following is a description of the directories/files in this repository (please update it whenever you add new material):

* **models** - This directory contains all the models and the training script.
* **scripts** - This is intended to be the common location for all the scripts.
* **logs** - This directory contains all the log files.
* **project_webpage** - This directory contains the webpage for final submission.

The project webpage can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/asrivast28/dl-project/blob/master/project_webpage/index.html).
